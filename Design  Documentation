Design Documentation: Optimized Garbage Classification Using scikit-learn
1. Overall Approach and Architecture
This project implements a traditional machine learning pipeline for image classification, specifically targeting the classification of different types of garbage 

without using deep learning techniques. The approach consists of the following key stages:

Image Preprocessing:

Convert RGB images to grayscale.

Apply histogram equalization to enhance contrast.

Use the Sobel edge detector to extract structural features.

Feature Extraction:

Statistical Features: Mean and standard deviation of pixel intensities.

Histogram Features: A histogram with 16 bins representing intensity distribution.

Edge Features: Edge density calculated using the Canny edge detector.

Texture Features: Approximated using pixel difference calculations, inspired by the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).

Region-Based Features: Average pixel intensities over a 4×4 grid (16 regions) to preserve spatial information.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Features are used to train a RandomForestClassifier.

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Feature importance is visualized to identify the most significant contributors.

2. Challenges Faced and Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Inconsistent lighting and poor contrast in images	Applied histogram equalization to normalize image brightness and contrast.
High computational cost of deep learning	Used classical machine learning with handcrafted features to ensure efficiency and simplicity.
Small or limited labeled dataset	Focused on extracting generalizable and robust features that do not require large data volumes.
Risk of model overfitting	Used a RandomForestClassifier, which handles overfitting well through ensemble learning.

3. Algorithm Selection Justification
The Random Forest Classifier was selected due to the following advantages:

Handles high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships effectively.

Resistant to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

Provides built-in feature importance scores for model interpretation.

Does not require feature scaling.

Supports parallel training via n_jobs=-1.

Although models such as SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression were considered, Random Forest was preferred for its simplicity, robustness, and interpretability in early-stage development.

4. Implementation Notes
A. Parameter Tuning
n_estimators=100: Chosen to balance training time and model accuracy.

random_state=42: Used to ensure consistent and reproducible results.

img_size=(128, 128): Selected as a compromise between image detail and processing efficiency.

Sobel edge kernel: ksize=3 – a commonly used kernel size for edge detection.

B. Performance Optimization
Grayscale conversion and histogram equalization reduce data complexity while enhancing important features.

Compact feature vectors (about 37 elements) ensure fast training and inference.

Code is modularized using clear function definitions (preprocess_image, extract_features, etc.) for scalability and reuse.

5. Future Work and Enhancements
Model Comparison:

Evaluate alternative models (SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) for potential performance improvements.

Data Augmentation:

Introduce rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments to increase training data diversity.

Feature Selection:

Use techniques like SelectKBest, PCA, or Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to optimize the feature set.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Employ GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best model parameters.

Deployment:

Package the model into a web app using Streamlit or Flask.

Export the trained model with joblib for integration into other systems.

Explainability:

Apply SHAP or LIME to interpret predictions and better understand model behavior.
